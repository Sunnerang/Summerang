Setup a kubernetes cluster, using minikube or not,
a minikube cluster setup, or a non-minikube cluster setup, or a non-cluster setup, or a non-setup. 

Cluster the same as a context, so both or neither, or cluster not the same as a context, so both, either or neither. 

We want a Linux- and bash-centric approach, with clear operations on files and directories, 
and with a clear directory-file view of the whole cluster. 
If we use devspace to develop and deploy, we must use either helm, kubectl or kustomize, 
of which we choose the one method that is is most transparent about it's directory-file operations.
